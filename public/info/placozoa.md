The phylogenetic placement of Placozoa is highly debated. Morphologically it seems clear that Placozoans are more basal than Ctenophores due to their lack of tissues (nervous and muscular), but modern genomic studies place Ctenophora as less basal. Different diagrams may place Ctenophores as sister to all other animals, sister to all other Eumetazoans (as in this diagram), or less commonly, elsewhere. If you are to believe this diagram, it would imply that Ctenophores developed their tissues independently of all other animals.
