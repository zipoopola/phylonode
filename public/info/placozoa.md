The phylogenetic placement of Placozoa is highly debated. Morphologically it seems clear that Placozoans are more basal than Ctenophores due to their lack of tissues (nervous and muscular), digestive chamber, and symmetry, but modern genomic studies place Placazoans as less basal. Different diagrams may place Ctenophores as sister to all other animals, sister to all other Eumetazoans (as in this diagram), or less commonly, elsewhere. If you are to believe this diagram, it would imply that Ctenophores developed their tissues and digestive chamber independently of all other animals, or the ancestral ParaHoxzoan had lost them before evolving them again later.
