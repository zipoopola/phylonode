The image is a 3D reconstruction of a fossil that appears to be of the world's oldest animal. The fossil, called Otavia, appears to be a poriferoid (sponge). The fossil is dated to 720MYA, but its identity as an animal is highly contentious, as its fossils appear before the major diversification of modern phyla in the Cambrian.

Genetic and molecular analysis both place the last common ancestor (LCA) of animals at 650MYA.
