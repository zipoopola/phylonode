The most widely known Tunicate, shown above is a "Sea Squirt", a secondarily sessile, tailless, creature. It is difficult to see its relationship with its chordate relatives, unless looking at other mobile members of the group, such as the mobile larval stages and Thaliaceans and Larvaceans (which remain mobile into adulthood). 

The mobile larval stages as well as Larvaceans (who exhibit neoteny, hence the name) have notochords, nerve chords, pharyngeal slits, post-anal tails, and endostyles. The other main mobile group, the Thaliaceans, do not have tails, nerve chords nor noto chords.

A Salp-chain, a common occurence for Salps, (of Thaliaceans):

There are possible Tunicate remains dating back to the Ediacran with Burykhia hunti dating to 555MYA. It is considered of possibly ascidian affinity, due to the sac-like morphology and a series of distinctly perforated bands reminiscent of a tunicate pharynx.
