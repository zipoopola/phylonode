Modern phylogenomic studies place this group within Deuterostomia meaning it likely lost the more "derived" features of the rest of bilaterians (or that Protostomes, Chordates, and Ambulacrarians all developed the same organs, and through guts separately which is unlikely).

Image shows a member of the Xenoturbella, the other group is Acoelomorpha, who are similar in that they have (seemingly) lost their through-gut and other complex features.
