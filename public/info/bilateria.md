The image shows a reconstruction of the oldest known bilaterian fossil, Kimberella. It was thought that Kimberella lived similarly to gastropods. 

The first bilaterian must have been slightly older than this creature, and very small (<1cm), it had a simple brain and eyes, but no other true organs. The first bilaterian would have been mobile and had a simple gut, with only one opening. It is likely that soon after Acoelomorpha split off, the common ancestor of the rest of the group was segmented, with a heart, and a through gut.
