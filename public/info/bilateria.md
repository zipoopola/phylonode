The image shows a reconstruction of the oldest known bilaterian fossil, Kimberella. It was thought that Kimberella lived similarly to gastropods. 

The first bilaterian was slightly older than this creature. Modern phylogenomic studies place Xenacoelomorpha within Deuterostomia. This means that Xenacoelomorpha is secondarily basic, and that the bilaterian common ancestor would have had true organs, including a heart and a through gut, and was likely segmented.

Historically it was believed the first bilaterian would have been very small (<1cm), with a simple brain and eyes, but no other true organs. It was posited to have been mobile and had a simple gut, with only one opening. The theory was mostly morphological, and placed Xenacoelomorpha as the most basal group.
