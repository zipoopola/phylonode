The image show is the oldest confirmed Echinoderm member in the fossil record is known as the Helicoplacoids (around 515MYA). Its shape is similar to Helicocystis, but does not show the pentaradial symmetry found in all extant echinoderms. 

The second image shown is a basal member (c. 505MYA) of the Echinoderm group, Helicocystis. It is theorised to be close to the crown group. This, and the Helicoplacoids are a great example of the evolution from bilateral to pentaradial symmetry.


Helicocystis:

The Arkarua adami, is theorised to be an old echinoderm, but it is very old (555MYA), and doesn't have the calcium microstructure.

*Ideally the image would be updated
