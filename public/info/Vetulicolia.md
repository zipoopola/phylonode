Vetulicolia is a stem group of Chordates. Some favour a position sister to the tunicates, but most place it here. The absence of a post-anal tail in adults implies that the ancestral chordate had no tail or that Vetulicolia lost it separately. Alongside this, Tunicate larvae have been noted to have endoderm extending to the terminal end, suggesting ancestral lack of tails.

This likely means that lancelets and tunicate ancestors had a tail which tunicates secondarily reduced / lost.
