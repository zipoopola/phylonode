Vetulicolia is a stem group of Chordates. Some favour a position sister to the tunicates, but most place it here. The apendage resembling a tail is not a true post-anal tail as it does not continue the body axis and is a separate structure. This implies that the ancestral chordate had no tail or that Vetulicolia lost it separately. 

Alongside this, Tunicate larvae have been noted to have endoderm extending to the terminal end, suggesting ancestral lack of tails or secondary loss.

It most likely seems that lancelets and tunicate ancestors had a tail which tunicates secondarily reduced / lost.
